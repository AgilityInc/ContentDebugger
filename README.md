# Content Debugger
Allows you to inspect content files that are synced on your webserver.

## Setup
1. Download/clone the repo and copy the content within the ContentDebugger.cshtml file.
2. Create a new Page Template in Agility (no module zones) and tell it to use Inline Code. If using Inline Code, you do NOT need to make a deployment to your website code :)
3. Paste contents of the ContentDebugger.cshtml file as your Page Template code.
4. Create a new page and use the new Page Template you just created.
5. Browse to your page in a browser.
